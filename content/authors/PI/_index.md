# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research interests include various aspects of neuropsychology, as well as cognitive neuroscience and experimental psychology. I have also developed an interest in the contributions of neuroscience in the educational process, i.e. in the new field of educational neuroscience. The main focus of my work is on behavioural and brain lateralization (i.e., handedness and brain asymmetry), in healthy adults and children as well as in students with special education needs (students with dyslexia, dysgraphia, hearing impaired students, students in the Autism Spectrum, and students with low or high IQ). I am employing behavioural and brain imaging techniques (functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound, fTCD) and I am a member of the [Consortium on Language Asymmetry (COLA)] (https://colaconsortium.wordpress.com/2019/06/10/about-cola/). I have also worked in neuropsychopharmacology, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural and behavioral effects of antidepressant drug action and of mood induction on autobiographical memory. I am further interested in meta-science, with a special focus on meta-analysis, and fascinated about reproducible research. I am a member of the [Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA)] (https://psysciacc.org/), where I have also served as an Assistant Director for the Ethics Review Committee. I am also usually happy to collect Greek data for fellow researchers doing cross-cultural work. On the applied side, I am a Research Associate for [iConcipio] (https://www.iconcipio.com/), an online support provider based in London UK. iConcipio has developed an online support system for psycholocal and study skills difficulties faced by students in Higher Education, under the name MePlusMe. Last but not least, I am interested in science outreach, giving talks, writing a column named [“Let’s Science”] (https://a8inea.com/author/marietta-papadatou/) for a8inea.com, and writing short articles in the Greek press.
