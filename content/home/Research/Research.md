   description = """Morphological right-left asymmetry appears to be the rule, rather than the exception in nature, all the way from chiral molecules to the Baryon asymmetry in the universe. Asymmetry is the rule for biological systems as well, whereby even single-celled organisms are commonly asymmetric.  
Human beings are certainly structurally and functionally asymmetric, from the size of their feet and hands to the placement of visceral organs and facial features. In fact, the two aspects of behavior specific to humans, the use of language and the strong population-level preference for hand use, are both asymmetric, lateralized traits. When it comes to language, the majority of humans are left-hemisphere dominant for language functions, while the right hand is the preferred hand for over 9 out of 10 individuals; a pattern far from negligible.
Laterality is the main focus of our work. We have been studying behavioral laterality (e.g., handedness, footedness, and cradling laterality) as well as brain laterality (also known as brain asymmetry, hemispheric dominance, or hemispheric specialization). We are using meta-analytic methods, as well as behavioral, hormonal, and brain imaging techniques to study questions such as sex differences in handedness and brain lateralization, handedness in populations with special education needs, and cerebral laterality during writing. 
This endeavor, apart from its intrinsic interest, gains importance from the fact that the study of handedness and language lateralization contributes to the broader question of individual differences in brain organisation and abilities. Such differences are of key importance to psychiatric, neurological, and neuropsychological research and practice as well as to the study of the genetics of asymmetry."""

  description = """The almost explosive rate of growth in the research literature makes it increasingly diffi-cult for scientists to find the underpinning knowledge that the results carry; even more so when findings are confusing and conflicting. Literature reviews could never hope to han-dle such an abundance of data. 
Meta-analysis is a statistical method allowing for the integration and summarizing of the findings from a body of research in a clear, objective way. Importantly, meta-analysis al-lows for the assessment of any systematic variation among the results of different studies and, moreover, for the investigation of the sources of any such variance. Large-scale, high-ly powered meta-analyses can further help address the reproducibility issues that are at the forefront of scientific discussion within psychological research.
We have been applying meta-analytic methods in the field of laterality, a field overrun by the amount of published studies, with a special focus on handedness.  To date, we have investi-gated the prevalence of handedness, the sex differences in handedness, the prevalence of atypical handedness in populations with special educational needs (e.g., hearing impaired, Autism Spectrum, low or high intelligence) as well as in animals,  and further investigated  questions such as cradling laterality. We have also supported projects in terms of meta-analytic methods in the fields of mathematical cognition and ne-gotiations.

  description = "The term “neuromyths” was first used by neurosurgeon Alan Crockard in the 1980s to refer to unscientific ideas about the brain in medical culture. It was re-defined in 2002 by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and its [Brain and Learning project] (https://www.oecd.org/education/ceri/centreforeducationalresearchandinnovationceri-brainandlearning.htm) led by OECD’s Centre for Educational Research and Innovation (CERI) as “a misconception generated by a misunderstanding, a misreading, or a misquoting of facts scientifically established (by brain research) to make a case for use of brain research in education and other contexts”. 

Indeed, neuroscience is a complex field. The difficulty in understanding neuroscience findings creates fertile ground for a number of misinterpretations and of course neuromyths creation. The fact that findings do not lend themselves to direct implementation in the classroom coupled with flaws in the media coverage of neuroscientific discoveries further feeds the proliferation of neuromyths. 

We have done research on the prevalence of neuromyths amongst prospective teachers in Greece and have further published research focusing on the Learning Styles (LS) neuromyth. LS made an appearance in the 1950s, gained popularity in the 1970s, and are still a virtual truism amongst educators. The concept behind them holds some intuitive appeal, and states that providing information through different, but individually-specific, preferred modalities in instruction can improve learning. However, the concept has been heavily criticized. The CERI [has also recognised and categorised LS as a neuromyth] (https://www.oecd.org/education/ceri/neuromyth3.htm). Our studies add to the critical literature advocating against the use of LS in education.

   description = """Autobiographical memory (AM) is a memory of a personally experienced event that comes with a sense of recollection or reliving. AM is organized in a three-level hierarchy: (a) the first level contains memories of periods of life measured in years or decades; (b) the second level corresponds to general memories, such as repeated events distributed in time, measured in days, weeks or years, and (c) the third level comprises rare and specific events measured in minutes or hours. 
Overgeneral  AM is a recurrent [finding] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2834574/) in depression research. It has been proposed to be a stable marker of depression and to predict the course of depression. We have shown (Papadatou-Pastou et al., 2012) that acute administration of an antidepressant, such as the selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor reboxetine, increases the speed of AM retrieval and enhances neural responses in areas involved in cognitive processing during the retrieval of positive versus negative experiences in healthy, non-depressed volunteers in the absence of a change in mood. It has been also shown, however, that induced negative mood can reduce the specificity of AM in healthy volunteers. Thus, overgeneral AM could also be related to current emotional state.
In our current project, we seek to investigate the neural underpinnings of AM retrieval under induced (as opposed to naturally occurring) negative mood. Addressing the question of whether overgeneral autobiographical memory is a state or trait marker of depression is could not only assist in elucidating possible causal factors of depression, but it can further inform future therapeutic approaches. For example, state markers can be used to develop depression-prevention and relapse-prevention strategies.

   description = """The PI is part of a team developing a web-based psychological and academic support system for students in Higher Education ([MePlusMe] (https://www.iconcipio.com/) ).
Entering Higher Education (HE) is an exciting, yet challenging time. Students have a host of changes to manage, including making new relationships, living apart from friends and family, acquiring new study skills, and learning to function as independent adults. Several studies have indeed shown rising levels of anxiety and depression amongst HE students, compared to pre-university levels. Apart from severe mental health issues, mild to moderate psychological difficulties, which occur more frequently, can have a big negative impact on the life of students and often go undetected and unsupported. At the same time, the budget cuts of the HE Institutions (HEI) student support services (SSS) only add to the growing concern about the wellbeing of HE students.
Dealing with psychological and study skill difficulties can present a challenge for both Higher Education (HE) students, who suffer from them, but also for HE Institutions and their support services. Alternative means of support, such as online interventions, have been identified as cost-effective and efficient ways to provide inclusive support to HE students, removing many of the barriers to help seeking as well as promoting mental health and wellbeing.
In an attempt to meet this increased need for support for students with mild and moderate psychological as well as study skills difficulties, iConcipio developed an online support system designed specifically for HE students under the name MePlusMe. A rigorous approach to the development MePlusMe has been adopted. We have run a [survey] (https://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperInformation.aspx?paperID=83292) to ask end users what they like, a [proof-of-concept] (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2055207616655012) study, we have published the [protocol] (https://pilotfeasibilitystudies.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40814-015-0029-8) for a feasibility study, a [review] (https://ijmhs.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13033-017-0165-z) on other systems, as well as a [paper] (https://ijmhs.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13033-018-0233-z) describing our system. Next steps include a large-scale feasibility study and a randomized-control trial.
At the moment we are seeking to present the system to universities in order to receive funding or just collaborate in the feasibility study we are going to run soon. 
Here you can find out more about the system  and how it looks, including  (here) a short video on the philosophy of MePlusMe.

   description = """The [Psychological Science Accelerator] (https://psysciacc.org/) (PSA) is a globally distributed network of psychological science laboratories (currently over 500), representing over 70 countries on all six populated continents, that coordinates data collection for democratically selected studies. Our lab is a member of the PSA, having joined so far studies PSA001, PSA002, PSA002, PSA006 and PSA-COVID19. The PI has also served as an Assistant Director for the Ethics Review Committee.
PSA’s mission is to accelerate the accumulation of reliable and generalizable evidence in psychological science, reducing the distance between truth about human behavior and mental processes and our current understanding. This challenge cannot be adequately met by a single researcher or small team. Instead, we attempt to meet this challenge with a distributed laboratory network that is ongoing (as opposed to time or task limited), diverse (both in terms of human subjects and participating researchers), and inclusive (we welcome ideas, contributions, study proposals, or other input from anyone in the field of psychology).

Our lab participants in a large-scale, international consortium led by the Colour Psychology team headed by Prof. Christine Mohr at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. We aim to assess how color concepts (color terms) associate to a large variety of emotions. Having respondents from many languages and cultures, we assess their commonalities and differences that are potentially based on biological or culturally (in)variant experiences. Further, mappings consist in multiple interrelated colour-emotional associations rather than exclusive one-to-one relationships. These data build on a comprehensive inventory of semantic colour-emotion associations that will allow us and others to develop and test further research questions. Results may also foster neighbouring research areas, in particular on how colour-emotion associations shape color preferences.
